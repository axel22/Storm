Figurine - once you drop it, it turns to a powerful magical companion. This companion can take a lot of punishment. Once it's life force is drained it does not perish, but gets sent to its plane of existence where it recuperates, and cannot be used again until it regenerates. The companions may be told to return back to their plane. They have to do it anyway after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Once they return, all that is left is the magical figurine. There are all sorts of companions - for instance, a panther figurine harbours a mighty panther. Companions have a mind of their own - some companions may even turn against you. But in general they will obey their master, that is, the person who used the figurine to call them. The figurine itself is not destroyed easily, but if it is, the portal to the companion's plane of existence is forever closed.


Wild creatures - not all wild beasts will attack the moment they spot you. Creatures of the wild are known to be very cunning and skillful hunters. Sometimes a beast will follow you for days without you knowing, only to find the best moment for assault. It may be while you sleep, or when you're weak or outnumbered. If you suspect that you're being followed, a good idea is to lure the beast by pretending to be an easy catch.
